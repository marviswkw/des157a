            <p>Effective and accurate form design is essential for websites. Besides the graphic and visual presentation, functionalities and efficiency are key elements of creatisng forms. If we use forms ineffectively, it can bring negative effects on the visitors, the products, and the client or business. According to the article “Best practices for form design”, the author lists twenty useful guidelines for form usage on websites. He pointed out the critical but unnoticeable and inconspicuous part of form design that people often forgot or miss.</p>
       
            <p>I would like to highlight some design tips that I have learned from the article here. First, distinguishing optional and required fields is essential for a user-friendly website. Sometimes we overlook the necessity of the questions we have asked. By only including the essential questions,  it can keep the form with high simplicity and fasten the process of filling the forms. Moreover, explaining any input and formatting requirements is one of the useful tips too. Besides, I can pay more attention to the CTA button design with elements that can successfully draw users’ attention to the button as well as the action feedback.</p>

            <p>I have done the fragrance quiz on <a href ="https://www.cleanbeauty.com/pages/fragrance-finder">Clean Beauty Collective</a>’s website. It has an effective form design and maintains users’ engagement. Starting by asking simple questions with multiple steps and providing the percentage of completion with a progress bar, I can understand how long would I take for the quiz. The web page also includes asterisks to mark the required fields and keep the quiz short.</p>
