            <p>I used to think articles on the web is long and boring since I am not a reading person. It was hard to concentrate on a long, full of information and plain image web articles. To keep the audience engaged in it, interaction is one of the essential features of web design. In the article “ 10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills”, the author shows how New York Times uses photographs to provide interesting experiences on visual thinking to readers in its weekly program “What’s Going On in This Picture?”.  NY Times lets its readers to detect every little detail of the images in order to give an opportunity and platform for the audience to hone their visual thinking skills. We never know what was actually happening in that specific image or photo when it was taken so it is really important to let the audience think and be creative by asking open-ended questions and leading them toward any conclusion or the right answer. </p>
       
            <p>The microsite “Earth Month With A Redwood is a great example of using images and illustrations to enhance audience engagement. With hover and scrolling triggered animation, it educates the audience about their redwood glamping experience campaign. When we click on the figure illustration in the images, an overlay modal window will pop out and introduce the campaign details.</p>

            <p>The overlay window has various functions such as requesting user input, showing additional information in the context, and simply grabbing users' attention. I sometimes get annoyed by some overlay windows popping up and close them immediately without reading all the messages or contents because they are not being used effectively, especially some that ask for a subscription or invite to join the membership. Although I often got surprised by the pop-up dialog box of Canvas when the time of the quiz, the modals window is an effective way to catch users' attention in a second. </p>
       
            <p>The article “Best Practices for Modals/ Overlays / Dialog Windows”, provides useful tips on creating modal windows for the web page. The first important part of the modal design is the elements in it. The modal should include a title, a CTA button, an escape key, an appropriate size, and location, and greyed out the background of the parent page contents to inform users they are on a separate pop-up window. Besides, we need to consider the purpose of the modal and its necessity of it. I think it is a good way to use modals for promoting membership or tutorials on how to use the website but it should have a “don’t show it again today” option and make it more user-friendly. </p>

            <p>Effective and accurate form design is essential for websites. Besides the graphic and visual presentation, functionalities and efficiency are key elements of creatisng forms. If we use forms ineffectively, it can bring negative effects on the visitors, the products, and the client or business. According to the article “Best practices for form design”, the author lists twenty useful guidelines for form usage on websites. He pointed out the critical but unnoticeable and inconspicuous part of form design that people often forgot or miss.</p>
       
            <p>I would like to highlight some design tips that I have learned from the article here. First, distinguishing optional and required fields is essential for a user-friendly website. Sometimes we overlook the necessity of the questions we have asked. By only including the essential questions,  it can keep the form with high simplicity and fasten the process of filling the forms. Moreover, explaining any input and formatting requirements is one of the useful tips too. Besides, I can pay more attention to the CTA button design with elements that can successfully draw users’ attention to the button as well as the action feedback.</p>

            <p>I have done the fragrance quiz on <a href ="https://www.cleanbeauty.com/pages/fragrance-finder">Clean Beauty Collective</a>’s website. It has an effective form design and maintains users’ engagement. Starting by asking simple questions with multiple steps and providing the percentage of completion with a progress bar, I can understand how long would I take for the quiz. The web page also includes asterisks to mark the required fields and keep the quiz short.</p>
