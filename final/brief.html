            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I decided to update my Every Picture project. It is about a timeline journal of my best friend Gaby and me to celebrate our friendship.
            </p>

            <h2>Project Goal</h2>
            <p>
                The goals of my project are to challenge myself to try new image presentation methods. I have chosen the basic level for the project by using positioning and overlays. I want to create something with mouse-position image interactions and the images will show up automatically with scrolling to a specific position. </p>
                <p>Moreover, since the current design of the page is not attractive enough, I want to change the whole style of the page to give a minimal and clear presentation. Besides, I aim to create additional interactive features, not only on the button but also extend to other elements on the webpage.
            </p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                The design of the webpage will utilize black and white as the primary color scheme, with a theme color of blue used to create contrast. To maintain color consistency, all images will be edited with a Y2K halftone vibe and a blue filter. The timeline design will incorporate a rhythmic style and feature basic geometric shapes such as circles and rectangles to enhance the web page's conciseness.
            </p>

            <p>
               For typography, the "Climate crisis" font will be used for the heading and sub-heading, as it is a bulky, impactful font that will help it stand out. The content will utilize the Montserrat font, which is a visually appealing geometric font with high readability. Additionally, Montserrat is a sans-serif font that will ensure easy reading for users.  
            </p>

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                For this project, I will be implementing several features to enhance the user experience on the webpage. Firstly, I will include an automatic animation that will play at the beginning of the page after it loads. This animation will involve moving the timeline upwards from the bottom of the page, with a smooth and natural effect, allowing users to be introduced to the webpage in a more engaging manner.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I will add interaction when hovering over different elements on the page. This will help to indicate to users which elements are clickable and what actions they can take. For example, I will scale up the image on the timeline and add a border around it when hovering over it, to make it clear that it is clickable. Additionally, I will change the image from black and white to color to let users know which section they are focusing on, providing them with a more engaging and informative experience. 
            </p>

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>
                The experience goals of this project are to create an engaging and visually appealing user experience that showcases the special friendship between Gaby and me of the website. To achieve this, the website will feature interactive elements that guide users through the timeline journal, providing them with a sense of progression and flow. I have included overlays for my previous projects but I want to challenge myself to try something new and strengthen my image presentation skills to make the webpage clear and engaging.
